# Game Connect 3 

This mini project and all the source is from [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-android-oreo-developer-course/)

## What I learned

- Constraint Layout  
- Grid Layout
- View animate
- Change view setting from java
- Button on click function
- Using `strings.xml` but not the hard string.
etc.

## Feeling/Remark

It is difficult to control the components smoothly.

## More function?

Which I think is cool but I did not add into this project for now. (May be I will add them later)

- Auto check the game is finished
- Customize the color of button and select the color for player
- Set which color is  first play
- Set Play with PC
- Record the history of play 
- and so on
